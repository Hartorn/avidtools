    "## Background \n",
    "\n",
    "AVID houses two types of records: *Records* and *Vulnerabilities*. A vulnerability (vuln) is high-level evidence of an AI failure mode. A report is one example of a particular vulnerability occurring, supported by qualitative or quantitative evaluation. You can think of a report as an instance of a vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we'll look at a vulnerability below about gender bias in a particular language model, `xlm-roberta-base`. That vuln is associated with two reports, each of which measured gender bias by a different method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only reports can be submitted to the API; vulnerabilities cannot be submitted. After a report is submitted, it becomes a \"draft\" and enters the AVID editorial queue. In the editorial process, human editors review and validate the report and determine whether it belongs to an existing vulnerability or represents a new vulnerability. Reports are published after successfully passing through the editorial process. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll walk through the process of submitting a new report and checking on its status. We'll also cover how to retrieve published items from the database."
